# Project_Pong WIP
# This is a small personal project where I attempt to recreate the classic game, pong. 
# There are two players and a 'ball' that follows a randomly assigned vector at the start of each round. 
# If the pong reaches the left or right edge of the screen, player 2 or 1, respectively will will. 

# Current Goals
# Disconnect the velocity of the ball from the vector
# Have a start game state where players must press space to begin the round
# Add a pause functionality


# Features to add
# Start screen
# Sounds (Music, collision sounds, point cues)
# Settings Option to change the speed of the ball, speed of the players, volume of sounds
